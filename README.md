This project provides an efficient GPU-accelerated implementation of quantum stabilizer tableau canonicalization using CUDA and Julia. The implementation leverages custom CUDA kernels to accelerate key operations, such as column swapping, phase computation, and matrix updates, providing significant speedups over CPU-based approaches.
